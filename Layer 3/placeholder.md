# Given Coin Node Connectivity

This folder will be used for Layer 3 Network Layer
Whenever the blockchain needs to check* a consensus about the validity of a transaction it goes through this folder.

This layer is responsible for inter-node communication, in other words, with the use of Layer 1, and 2, we connect to other nodes in this layer using a P2P mechanism.

This layer needs to be used in functions from Layer 2 where blocks are created/blocks are added.
