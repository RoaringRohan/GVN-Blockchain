# GVN-Blockchain
Fundamental code for the GVN blockchain. Will act as an API back-end architecture to a MySQL database for now until the GVM (Given Virtual Machine) is created and a distributed ledger is implementable on individual nodes. Until then, backend API served with Express will have to do.
